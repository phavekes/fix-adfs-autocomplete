# Fix ADFS Autocomplete
This chrome-extension will enable autocomple on ADFS username- and password fields

The extension can be installed on [the chrome webstore](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/fix-adfs-autocomplete/bnhnojjemdefncfdglbdncmflppaknmp)

It will work on all websites with **/adfs/ls/** in the url. It will add **autocomplete=username** and **autocomplete=current-password** to the username and password fields, so you don't have to type the username, and your passwordmanager will work again.
